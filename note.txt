MAPTY APP:  OOP, GEOLOCATION, EXTERNAL LIBRARIES AND MORE

// USING Goelocation API
STEPS 1, 
Using navigator.geolocation with a third party called leaflet to display the map from recieving location from geolocation API

2) Add eventlistener on the map using map.on

3) Remove hidden style on form if click on map 

4) Adding Event Listener on form with 'Submit' event type

5) Add display Maker into to display after submoitting form, With the help of leaflet documents to modify the maker

6) Listen to Input typle to add toggle method to input value in change of elevation or cadense

7) refined my code using constrction funtion 

8) create classes for workout data

9) Then move forward to saving the input value and checking if correct or wrong

Using Guard clause (mean using opposite) to check if value is valid *check if a number and also greater than 0 except elevationz

10) push inputs to workout array

11) Rendering Workout in the sidebar of the user interface

12) Remove form after submitting 

13) Add event Listener to the on workout submit to move map to workout location

14) Working wit local storae API in iter to make workout persist across multiple page reloads

15) now display workout on the interface even after reloading the page and also marker position 

but we lost prototype chain by changing object to string and to object back

So basically, that object coming from local storage will not inherite all the methods that they did before

16) to clear all workout on storages (app.reset()) in browser console
